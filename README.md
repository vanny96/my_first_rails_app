# README

This is the 'My first rails app" project from the ["The Odin Project"](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/your-first-rails-application) course.

Even tough it's called "**My** first rails app" it is only a tutorial where I follow the instructions step by step.
